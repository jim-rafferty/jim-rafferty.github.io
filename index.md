I am a statistician in [Population Data Science](https://popdatasci.swan.ac.uk/) at [Swansea University Medical School](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/medicine/). 

Most of my research involves doing statistical modelling using data held in the [SAIL Databank](https://saildatabank.com/), which is a trusted research environment that links large scale health and administrative data collected on people living in Wales. I'm interested in building ever more complicated models that incorporate time dependence to understand lots of interesting things about peoples health and wellbeing. These days I'm mostly using Bayesian statistics. In the past I've worked on multimorbidity clustering, projects related to diabetes, epidemiology of concussion injuries in rugby union, analysis of MRI data and (in the very distant past) theoretical physics. 

This website will mostly contain resources for statistics and programming which may be of interest to statisticians and data scientists. 

At the moment I'm working on the [MAGENTA project](https://magentaresearch.org/).
